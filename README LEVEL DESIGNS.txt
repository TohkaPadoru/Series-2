Level 1- A small Platformer type of game where some of the platforms will disappear if you stand on them
for too long. Be quick On your feet and try hit all the switches to disable the barricades blocking your path
to the exit. In this level there are no large challenges except for the platforms that disappear after you touch
them as the player. Hint: If you are quite good at parkour or controlling your character you can actually pass
the stage while only triggering one Switch and getting rid of one barricade.

level 2-This stage is all about speed. Your character will barely be able to jump and the goal of this level
is to reach the end of the stage by either disabling the platforms through switches or by kicking a cube into
the goal. You may try to reach the end of the level without hitting the switches but be aware that all the
light blue platforms in this level will disappear after a quick touch. Some blocks may try to get in your way
and you may either wait them out or Dodge them as you make your way through this fast paced level.

level 3- In this level you must be quick. As timers will toggle barricades on and off allowing you to board
the plane and flying to the end. Make good use of the skills obtained from the other levels to Hit the switches
and make it to the front of the plane in time. Once you reach the front of the plane it will teleport you to
your final destination
